I'm choosing 20210707 (2nd flight) as I found this flight to contain most vegetation with least weed, while 20230821 for vegetation masking as the vegetation has expanded  with minimal weed (although there are a lot of weed here).
Additionally I had to change the wave length combination as 2023 data was taken with mavic 3m
Increased the vegetation threshold for easier detection.
